## What is the purpose of this website?

In its infancy stages, this tool will use the file directory to store and serve the blog pages. This allows others to easily contribute to the website without the need of building a **CMS (Content Management System)** and also means that adjustments can be made in the source control!

However, this means there is a little bit more of a skill ceiling for contributing and you will need to understand some technologies. For basic usage you will need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - A source control tool.
- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) - A lightweight markup language that allows simple formattings.

For more advanced usage and providing feature changes for this tool you will need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) - The JavaScript runtime environment that allows this app to run!
- [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) - A framework for developing web apps using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A programming language that builds upon Javascript to give type safety.
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A CSS utility framework that speeds up styling websites.

Obviously there are a lot more rabbit holes to go down if you are a beginner like CSS, JavaScript etc. but hopefully we can use this platform to help expand each others knowledge.

## How to contribute to this knowledge base?

I'll not cover any of the installation or setup of the above tools and just assume that you have got them already. If that's not the case, then this is an example of where we can provide information to help each other solve these problems on our own!

First things first, *how should you contribute?*

Since this will be using static files read from the directories of the web app, you will essentially just be adding files into folders. So you can either add them directly on the source control *or* clone the project and add the files using an IDE or Text Editor of your choosing.
